Mod reduces the width of the tabs in the research menu by half.

The mod can help you if you have a lot of mods with different research trees.

If there are more than 13 research trees, scroll buttons appear.

The mod reduces the width of tabs only in the research menu. The tabs in the statistics menu and the mods menu remain unchanged.
