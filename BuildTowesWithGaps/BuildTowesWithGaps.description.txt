The mod activates the "Building Towers with Gaps" mode in "Build many buildings at once" mod.

"Build many buildings at once" mod is REQUIRED.



Now player can leave gaps between towers from 0 to 6 cells.

To increase the number of free cells, start building (hold down the left mouse button) and use the mouse wheel.



The new mode allows the player to quickly and beautifully massively build towers.



The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

Updated to DLC3.
