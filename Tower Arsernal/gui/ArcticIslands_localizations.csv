gui/menu/planetary_scanner/mission_ArcticIslands_new_resource_description;Orbital Scanning detected a Cosmonite rich location within the arctic plains. Go there to gather more information about the abundance of cosmonite ore, to learn if there is enough of it to establish a permanent mining outpost.;

gui/menu/planetary_scanner/mission_ArcticIslands_alien_base_description;Thorough study of dark energy wave emissions from X-Morph pylons suggests that this location houses some kind of central communications hub. Long-range scans indicate that there is a single narrow path leading to the main location.;

gui/menu/planetary_scanner/mission_ArcticIslands_find_samples;Cosmic Yeast Colony Research;
gui/menu/planetary_scanner/mission_ArcticIslands_find_samples_description;Cosmic yeast colonies have been detected in this area. Construct a Research Station near one of the colonies' roots to learn how the yeast metabolizes cosmonite. This should help us with tracking larger deposits of this resource. Acidic shielding is highly recommended for this mission.;

DIALOG/story/ArcticIslands/ashley_find_samples_01;Good, we need to get close to the central root of one of these colonies and construct a Research Station near it. This isn't going to be easy.;
DIALOG/story/ArcticIslands/ashley_find_samples_02;Ok, this looks like the central root of the colony. Now we have to build a Research Station close to it to start the scanning procedure.;
DIALOG/story/ArcticIslands/ashley_find_samples_03;Great, now we just have to maintain power to the Research Lab and let it gather the necessary data.;
DIALOG/story/ArcticIslands/ashley_find_samples_04;We're halfway through analyzing the root of the acidic yeast colony. The data is already looking very promising.;
DIALOG/story/ArcticIslands/ashley_find_samples_05;That's very interesting. It looks like we've been recognized as a threat, the colonies are trying to devour our base.;
