The mod adds Sell Depleted Mines Tool that allows player to sell depleted mines all over the map.

Mines that will be sold are highlighted in yellow.

The mines will be sold by clicking the left mouse button.

The returned resources will be shown before selling the mines.

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tool will appear in the new game and in saves.
