The mod adds 15 new Teleport skills that deal damage to enemies.

Emergency Teleport deals damage before teleporting.
Attack Teleport deals damage after teleporting.
Combined Teleport deals damage both before and after teleporting.

Damage dealt by Teleport skills can be of the following types:
- Area
- Acid
- Energy
- Fire
- Cryo

The damage dealt by Teleport skills is equivalent to Power Jump skills.

New teleport skills are in the "Teleport Skills" research tree.

New teleport skills can only be researched after researching the standard Teleport skill in the "Alien Research" tree.

It is necessary to research "Alien Research – Level 2" before researching the teleport skills quality "Advanced".
It is necessary to research "Alien Research – Level 3" before researching the teleport skills quality "Superior".
It is necessary to research "Alien Research – Level 4" before researching the teleport skills quality "Extreme".

It is necessary to research both the "Attack Teleport" and the "Emergency Teleport" before researching the "Combined Teleport".

Category "Teleport" has been added to the movement skill selection list.


To unlock the new research tree in saves, use mod "Unlock custom researches in saves".
