The mod changes the Base Lamps so that they begin to distribute energy as energy connectors.

The energy distribution radius of the Base Lamps is the same as that of the energy connectors.

Now Base Lamps do not require 1/sec energy to work.

The mod adds new skill Base Lamps Trail.

Base Lamps are built along the path of the mech-suit while the skill is working.

The currently selected Base Lamps will be built.

Extra Stable Floor will be built on quicksand before building the Base Lamp.

The skill icon is displayed above the mech-suit while the skill is working.
