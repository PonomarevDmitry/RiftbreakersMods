The mod changes Base and Crystal Lamps so that they begin to distribute energy as energy connectors.

Base and Crystal Lamp's energy distribution radius is the same as that of the energy connectors.

Now Base and Crystal Lamps do not require 1/sec energy to work.

The mod adds new skills Base Lamps Trail and Crystal Lamps Trail.

Lamps are built along the path of the mech-suit while the skill is working.

The currently selected Base or Crystal Lamps will be built.

Extra Stable Floor will be built on quicksand before building a Lamp.

The skill icon is displayed above the mech-suit while the skill is working.
