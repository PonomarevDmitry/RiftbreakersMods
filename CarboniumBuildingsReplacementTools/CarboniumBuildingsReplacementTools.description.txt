The mod adds two tools that allow the player to replace Carbonium Factories with Carbonium Powerplants and vice versa.

The mod consists of two tools:
- Replace Factories with Powerplants
- Replace Powerplants with Factories


The building is replaced with the same level or with a lower available level.

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tools will appear in the new game and in saves.
