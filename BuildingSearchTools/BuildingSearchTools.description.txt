The mod adds two new tools to search buildings.

Buildings Mark Tool allows player to mark building on the map.
The tool has the following operating modes:
- Select Building to Mark
- Select Building Group to Mark
- Select Building Category to Mark
- Mark One of Last 20 selected buildings for construction in Build Mode



Buildings Unmark Tool allows player to unmark from building on the map.
The tool has the following operating modes:
- Select Building to Unmark
- Select Building Group to Unmark
- Select Building Category to Unmark
- Unmark All Buildings
- Unmark One of Last 20 selected buildings for construction in Build Mode



The mode of operation of the tools can be changed with the mouse wheel.

1. "Select Building" mode of the tools marks or unmarks from the selected building and all its upgrades and downgrades.

2. "Select Building Group" mode of the tools marks or unmarks from the selected building group, all its upgrades and downgrades.

For example, if the player picks a Basic Wall, then the Buildings Mark Tool in mode "Select Building to Mark" will mark Basic Walls (and all upgrades and downgrades) only.
And in mode "Select Building Group to Mark" the tool will mark all Basic, Energy and Crystal Walls.
Basic, Energy and Crystal Walls are included in the same group.
if the player picks a Tower, then the Buildings Mark Tool in mode "Select Building Group to Mark" will mark all Towers (and all upgrades and downgrades).

3. "Select Building Category" mode of the tools marks or unmarks buildings of the selected category and all their upgrades and downgrades.

4. When the player selects a building to build, the mod saves the selected building and allows the player to select that building to mark or unmark.

The mod saves the last 20 selected buildings for construction.



The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tools will appear in the new game and in saves.
