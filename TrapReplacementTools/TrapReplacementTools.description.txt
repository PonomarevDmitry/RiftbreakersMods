The mod adds two sets of tools that allow the player to replace traps with others.

The first set of tools consists of tool "Trap Type Picker Tool" and tool "Replace All Selected Traps with Picked Trap Type".

The "Trap Type Picker Tool" tool allows the player to select the type of trap that other traps will be replaced with when using the "Replace All Selected Traps with Picked Trap Type" tool.

The "Replace All Selected Traps with Picked Trap Type" tool allows the player to select an area, and all traps in that area will be replaced by traps of the selected type.

It is necessary that the type of trap to replace is selected when using the "Replace All Selected Traps with Picked Trap Type" tool.
A warning will be displayed if the trap type is not selected.



The second set of tools consists of four tools:
- Trap Type 1 Picker Tool
- Trap Type 2 Picker Tool
- Replace Selected Traps Type 1 with Type 2
- Replace Selected Traps Type 2 with Type 1

Tools "Trap Type 1 Picker Tool" and "Trap Type 2 Picker Tool" allow the player to select trap Type 1 and trap Type 2.

The "Replace Selected Traps Type 1 with Type 2" tool allows the player to select an area, and all Type 1 traps in that area will be replaced by Type 2 traps.

On the contrary, the "Replace Selected Traps Type 2 with Type 1" tool allows the player to select an area, and all Type 2 traps in that area will be replaced by Type 1 traps.

It is necessary that trap Type 1 and trap Type 2 are selected when using tools "Replace Selected Traps Type 1 with Type 2" and "Replace Selected Traps Type 2 with Type 1".
A warning will be displayed if trap Type 1 or trap Type 2 is not selected.



The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tools will appear in the new game and in saves.
