The mod makes the size of the scanned object important.

The larger the object, the more scanning points player get.

Scanning points received:
if ( size <= 2.5 ) then 2 points
if ( 2.5 < size <= 4.5 ) then 4 points
if ( 4.5 < size <= 9.5 ) then 8 points
if ( 9.5 < size ) then 20 points

"Scanner Drones" mod is required.

The mod is compatible with all "Scanner Drones" sub-mods.
