The mod allows the player to build many buildings by holding the left mouse button.

Now the player can build many buildings without fear that one of them will move and ruin the line.

Now if a building blueprint is colored yellow, it means that this building will overwrite another building.
In this case, both the new building and the removed building will be colored yellow.

A building colored yellow can be built.
The yellow color is just a signal for convenience.

Changed files:
- lua/misc/ghost.lua
- lua/misc/ghost_building.lua

Updated to DLC2.
