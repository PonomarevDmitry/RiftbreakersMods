The mod adds a HQ Move Tool that moves the Headquarters to another location.

The HQ Move Tool allows the player to select a new Headquarters location and start building the Headquarters at the new location.

The Headquarters CANNOT be moved if
1. There is no headquarters on the current map.
2. The Headquarters is currently being built or upgraded.
3. The Headquarters can be upgraded.
4. The player does not have enough resources to build a new headquarters.
5. The new location for the Headquarters is too close to another portal (the existing Headquarters is also taken into account).

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tool will appear in the new game and in saves.

Localizations:
- English
- Russian
- Chinese (Great thanks STAR-KY-XH @ discord)
