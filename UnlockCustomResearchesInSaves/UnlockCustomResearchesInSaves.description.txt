The mod fixes the bug when adding a mod with a custom research tree and the player cannot start new research.

When adding a mod, it often happens that when loading a save, research from a new tree cannot be started.
But all the necessary requirements for unlocking have been met.

For example, this happens with mods Scanner Tower, Grenades Plus.

In mod "Scanner Tower":
If the "Alien Research" was completed before installing the mod, then it will be impossible to start research "Scanner Tower" due to the bug.

In mod "Grenades Plus":
If the research "Grenade – Standard" was completed before installing the mod, then it will be impossible to start research "Elemental Grenades – Standard" due to the bug.

The mod unlocks new researches and allows player to start them.

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.
