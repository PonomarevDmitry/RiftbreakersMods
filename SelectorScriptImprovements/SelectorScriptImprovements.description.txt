This technical mod makes changes to "selector.lua" script to make the game easier.

1. Now "selector.lua" script saves the floor size for all floor types.

2. Now "selector.lua" script saves the size for all tools (except Picker and Sell Tools).

3. Player can change the area of a building by moving the mouse wheel down when selecting a building (displaying the building action menu).
Moving an area of a building is only possible if the appropriate mod for this building is installed.
