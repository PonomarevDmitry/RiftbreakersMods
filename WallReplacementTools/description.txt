The mod adds two tools for replacing selected walls with energy or basic ones.

Replace Selected Walls with Energy Walls
Replace Selected Walls with Basic Walls

The wall is replaced with the same level or with a lower available level.

If the walls are not available for construction, a warning will be shown.

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tools will appear in the new game and in saves.
