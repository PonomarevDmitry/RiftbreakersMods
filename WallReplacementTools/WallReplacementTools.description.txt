The second set of tools consists of tool "Wall Type Picker Tool" and tool "Replace All Selected Walls with Picked Wall Type".

The "Wall Type Picker Tool" tool allows the player to select the type of wall that other walls will be replaced with when using the "Replace All Selected Walls with Picked Wall Type" tool.
Use mouse wheel to select the previous selected wall.

The "Replace All Selected Walls with Picked Wall Type" tool allows the player to select an area, and all walls in that area will be replaced by walls of the selected type.

It is necessary that the type of wall to replace is selected when using the "Replace All Selected Walls with Picked Wall Type" tool.
A warning will be displayed if the wall type is not selected.



The third set of tools consists of four tools:
- Wall Type 1 Picker Tool
- Wall Type 2 Picker Tool

- Replace Selected Walls Type 2 with Type 1

Tools "Wall Type 1 Picker Tool" and "Wall Type 2 Picker Tool" allow the player to select wall Type 1 and wall Type 2.

The "Replace Selected Walls Type 1 with Type 2" tool allows the player to select an area, and all Type 1 walls in that area will be replaced by Type 2 walls.

On the contrary, the "Replace Selected Walls Type 2 with Type 1" tool allows the player to select an area, and all Type 2 walls in that area will be replaced by Type 1 walls.
