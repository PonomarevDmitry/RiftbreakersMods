The mod adds Free Roam Camera Tool to move and rotate Camera.

Click on a point on the ground to move the Camera.
Use the mouse wheel to rotate the Camera.


The Camera will return to Mr. Riggs when the tool is deactivated.

WARNING:
The Camera starts going crazy at some angles of rotation.


The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tool will appear in the new game and in saves.
