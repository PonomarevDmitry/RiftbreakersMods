The mod adds Free Roam Camera Tool to move and rotate Camera.

Click on a point on the ground to move the Camera.
Use the mouse wheel to rotate the Camera.

The tool has a mode for fast continuous camera movement.
To enter the mode, the player must press and hold the left mouse button for half a second.
The tool will begin to continuously move the camera towards the selected point on the ground.


The Camera will return to Mr. Riggs when the tool is deactivated.

WARNING:
The Camera starts going crazy at some angles of rotation.


The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tool will appear in the new game and in saves.
