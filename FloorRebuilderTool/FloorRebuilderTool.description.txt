The mod adds Floor Rebuilder Tool that allows player to rebuild floors.

Floor Rebuilder Tool allows the player to fix the wrong floor tiles on the selected area without removing the floor and building the floor again.

Floor Rebuilder Tool allows the player to select an area and rebuild a floor on that area.
The tool fills the selected area with floor tiles of the selected size.

The tool will build a floor of the type that has already been built on the selected area.

If there are several types of floors on the selected area, then the most common floor on the selected area will be built.

The tool will do nothing if there is no floor on the selected area.


The tool allows the player to continue the floor very quickly without searching for the floor in the build menu.




The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tool will appear in the new game and in saves.
