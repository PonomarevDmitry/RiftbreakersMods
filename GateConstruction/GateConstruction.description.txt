The mod adds an individual building mode to all Wall Gates.

The building mode coincides with the general building mode from mod "Build many buildings at once".

The only difference in the building mode is that if the back cells of the gate are occupied by walls, then the wall gate will be rotated 180 degrees.

If at least one front cells of the gate is occupied with walls, then the gate will not be rotated.

The new building mode allows the player to quickly and beautifully massively build gates.

Changed files:
- entities/buildings/defense/wall_gate.ent
- entities/buildings/defense/wall_gate_lvl_2.ent
- entities/buildings/defense/wall_gate_lvl_3.ent
