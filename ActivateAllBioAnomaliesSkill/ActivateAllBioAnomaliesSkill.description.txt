The mod adds new skill Activate All Bioanomalies.

The first activation of any bioanomaly triggers a wave of aggressive creatures.
Activate All Bioanomalies skill allows player to activate all bioanomalies on the map and launch all waves of creatures.

It is necessary to hold the skill activation button for 5 seconds to release the activation wave.

After using this skill, each bioanomaly will be opened in 2.5 seconds.



The skill does not open bioanomalies and does not spawn loot.
To open a bioanomaly and get loot, the player needs to open it in the usual way.


The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New skill will appear in the new game and in saves.
