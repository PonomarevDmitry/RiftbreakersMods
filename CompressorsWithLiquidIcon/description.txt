The mod adds resource icons above Liquid Compressors and Liquid Decompressors in Build Mode.

The mod changes the resource selection icon to the current selected resource's icon in the Liquid Decompressor.

If a resource is not selected in the Liquid Decompressor, the message "Select Resource" will be displayed above it.
If the Liquid Compressor is not connected to a resource, the message "Connect Resource" will be displayed above it.

Liquid Decompressor with an unselected resource will be displayed on the minimap as a blue plus icon.

Liquid Compressor that is not connected to the resource will be displayed on the minimap as a blue plus icon.

Resource icon will be shown in new game and saves.
