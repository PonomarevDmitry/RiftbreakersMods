The mod changes Heavy Artillery Towers and HCM Towers so Towers uses liquids only when firing.

Heavy Artillery Towers need to be rebuilt for the mod to work.

Changed files:
- entities/buildings/defense/tower_heavy_artillery .ent
- lua/buildings/defense/tower_hcm .lua

Updated to Riftbreaker to 2.0.
