The mod adds an individual building mode to all Traps.

The building mode coincides with the general building mode from mod "Build many buildings at once".

The only difference is that player can leave gaps between traps from 0 to 6 cells.

The number of gaps cells is changed by the mouse wheel.

The new building mode allows the player to quickly and beautifully massively build traps.


Changed files:
- entities/buildings/defense/trap_acid.ent
- entities/buildings/defense/trap_area.ent
- entities/buildings/defense/trap_cryo.ent
- entities/buildings/defense/trap_energy.ent
