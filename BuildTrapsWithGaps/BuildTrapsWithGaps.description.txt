The mod adds an individual building mode to all Traps.

The building mode coincides with the general building mode from mod "Build many buildings at once".

The only difference is that player can leave gaps between traps from 0 to 6 cells.

The number of gaps cells is changed by the mouse wheel.

The new building mode allows the player to quickly and beautifully massively build traps.

该模组为所有陷阱添加了单独的建筑模式。

建筑模式与“同时建造许多建筑”模组中的一般建筑模式一致。

唯一的区别是玩家可以在陷阱之间留下 0 到 6 个格子的间隙。

间隙单元的数量通过鼠标滚轮改变。

新的建造模式允许玩家快速而精美地大规模建造陷阱。
