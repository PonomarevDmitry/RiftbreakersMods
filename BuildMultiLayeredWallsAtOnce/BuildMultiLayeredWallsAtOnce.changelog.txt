Multi Layered Wall building now works with other custom walls from other mods.
For example, with walls from the Expanded Arsenal mod.

Version 1.3

Now the indicator number does not indicate the number of wall layers, but the number of occupied cells for the wall.

Layer Order:
    "1",

    -- 2
    "11",

    -- 3
    "101",        
    "111",

    -- 4
    "1011",
    "1111",

    -- 5
    "10101",
    "11111",

    -- 6
    "101011",
    "111111",

    -- 7
    "1010101",

    -- 8
    "10101011",

    -- 9
    "101010101",

    -- 10
    "1010101011",

    -- 11
    "10101010101",

"1" - wall
"0" - empty cell
