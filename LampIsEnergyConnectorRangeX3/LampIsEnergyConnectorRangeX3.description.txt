The mod changes Base and Crystal Lamps so that they begin to distribute energy as energy connectors.

Base and Crystal Lamp's energy distribution radius is triple the radius of the energy connectors.

Now Base and Crystal Lamps do not require 1/sec energy to work.

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.
