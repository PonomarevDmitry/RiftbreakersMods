The mod expands the switch tool.

Added two variations of the switch tool.

The first variation only turns on the selected buildings.

The second variation only turns off the selected buildings.

Unlike the switch tool, two new variations allow the player to hold down the mouse button, move the selection area,
and turn selected buildings on or off.

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as almost all files in this mod are new.

Changed files:
- lua/misc/switch_tool.lua

Also fixed a bug:
The user can use the switch tool to turn off a building that cannot be turned off through the menu of the building itself.
The bug happens with buildings: HQ, outpost, wind turbine, solar panel.

New switch tool variations will appear in the new game and in saves.

Localizations:
- English
