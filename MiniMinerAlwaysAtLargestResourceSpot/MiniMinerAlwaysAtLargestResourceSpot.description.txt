The mod changes Mini Miner Consumable script.

Now the Mini Miner will be built at a free resource point with the largest amount of resources.

Now there will no longer be situations when a player installs a Mini Miner, spends a precious consumable, and the Mini Miner is built on a poor resource point and works for a few seconds.
Now if the Mini Miner works for a few seconds, it will deplete any other resource point in this resource deposit.

Changed files:
- lua/items/consumables/mini_miner .lua

Updated to Riftbreaker to 2.0.
