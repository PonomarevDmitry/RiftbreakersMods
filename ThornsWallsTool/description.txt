The mod adds Thorns Walls Tool that allows player to build thorns walls.

If the player builds a horizontal wall, then the Thorns will be vertical wall segments that taunt creatures.

The currently selected Wall level will be built.

The length of the Thorn can be changed with the mouse wheel.
Possible Thorn length:
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6
- 8
- 10

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tools will appear in the new game and in saves.
