Version 1.4
Updating Chinese localization (Great thanks STAR-KY-XH @ discord).

The Picker Tool has a new function for clearing the template. To clear the template, the player needs to make five quick clicks on an empty point with no buildings selected. After five quick clicks, the player will be prompted to clear the template.

The Picker Tool has a new function to change first building (and center building) in the template.
To change the first building in the template, the player needs to hold down the left mouse button, reduce the area of the Picker Tool so that only one building falls into the area, and for some time point at the required building, which is already in the template.
After some time, the required building will become the first in the template and will change its highlight to blue.
