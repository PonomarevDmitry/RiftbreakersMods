The mod adds new skill "Temporary Rift Portal".

The skill creates a temporary rift in spacetime allowing immediate travel to its location.

Other temporary rift portals will be destroyed when using the skill and creating a new temporary rift portal.

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New skill will appear in the new game and in saves.
