monster_description/cosmic_canceroth_boss;The Canceroth, an enigmatic and formidable entity endemic to the Swamp biome, presents a multifaceted challenge to explorers. It features a central node surrounded by smaller cells, collectively wreaking havoc as they traverse the terrain without heed for obstacles. While targeting smaller cells can temporarily diminish their threat, the central node must ultimately be destroyed, a task complicated by the surrounding cells' protective function.;
