The mod adds tools to copy a sapling from one cultivator to another.

Cultivator Plant Picker Tool saves the sapling from the selected cultivator for insertion into another.
If the saved sapling and the current sapling in the cultivator match, the Cultivator Plant Picker Tool does not highlight the cultivator.

Cultivator Plant Replacer Tool replaces the sapling with the one saved in all selected cultivators.
If the saved sapling and the current sapling in the cultivator match, the Cultivator Plant Replacer Tool does not highlight the cultivator.

The icon and the name of the saved sapling are displayed above the selection area.

Tools only work with cultivators.

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tools will appear in the new game and in saves.
