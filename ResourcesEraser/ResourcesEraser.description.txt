The mod adds a Resources Eraser Tool that allows player to remove resource sources.

Resource sources will be completely destroyed.

The Resources Eraser Tool can be useful if resource sources are inconveniently located on the map and there is no time to extract them.

The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tool will appear in the new game and in saves.
