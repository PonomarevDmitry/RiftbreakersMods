The mod adds five new tools for selling buildings.

Building to Sell Picker Tool selects a building type to sell.
Use mouse wheel to select the previous selected building.


Sell Buildings Tool only sells the selected building type.

Sell Buildings Group Tool only sells the selected building group.


Sell Buildings and Place Ruins Tool only sells the selected building type and leaves ruins in place of buildings.

Sell Buildings Group Tool only sells the selected building group and leaves ruins in place of buildings.


For example, if the player picks a Basic Wall, then the Sell Buildings Tool will sell the Basic Walls (and all upgrades and downgrades) only.
And the Sell Buildings Group Tool will sell both Basic Walls and Energy Walls.
Basic and Energy Walls are included in the same group.

Buildings that can be sold are highlighted in green.

Buildings that will be sold are highlighted in yellow.


The mod will not conflict with any other mods as all files in this mod are new.

New tools will appear in the new game and in saves.
