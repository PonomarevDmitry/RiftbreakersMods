DIALOG/story/endgame/ashley_mega_rift_charging_01;No. I don't think so. This rift is opening very slowly. I'm not sure why you thought this would be any simpler than the first portal.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/story/endgame/mech_mega_rift_charging_02;That might have been a small miscalculation. Ashley, I think we have a bigger problem. I am detecting a lot of movement heading towards the Rift Station.;;;;;;;;;

DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_a;Ashley, my sensors are picking up anomalous readings within this location.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_b;Ashley, I am detecting some unusual data patterns in this sector.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_c;Anomalous signals detected. Something does not fit within this area.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_d;Something strange is happening in this zone. I am getting readings that are inconsistent with the surrounding environment.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_e;My instruments are detecting anomalous fluctuations in this location. The source is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_a;Interesting. Can you locate these readings?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_b;Can you pinpoint the source?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_c;Ok, you have my attention. Can you share any more specific information?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_d;Noted. Can you provide coordinates for the source?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_e;Understood. Can you explain the nature of the anomaly?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_a;Yes, but I need some time to gather more data.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_b;The readings are inconsistent. I need more time to analyze the data.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_c;I am in the process of triangulating the origin. Please stand by for updated coordinates. This may take some time.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_d;I have detected a pattern, but it is too weak to determine its origin conclusively. Please give me more time to analyze the data.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_e;My data is fragmented. I need more time to reconstruct its point of origin.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_a;Ok, let's try to find it ourselves in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_b;Alright, we will keep moving and see what turns up.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_c;Understood. I will continue searching until you have something solid.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_d;Guess we’ll have to do it the old-fashioned way for now. We’ll poke around and see what we find.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_e;Just let me know when you've got something concrete. I’ll keep moving.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_a;Data analysis complete. I have an approximate location of the anomaly that I detected earlier.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_b;I have completed processing the data from the anomaly that I recorded a few minutes ago. I have marked its approximate position.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_c;The results of the earlier anomaly scan are conclusive. I am uploading its estimated location to our map.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_d;I have finished analyzing the signals from the previously observed anomaly. I have marked its approximate location.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_e;I have finished processing the data from the anomaly that I recorded earlier. I have calculated an approximate position for investigation.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_a;Excellent. Mark it on our map and let's see what it is.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_b;Alright, let’s see what kind of weirdness we’re dealing with.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_c;Nice. I’ve been waiting to figure out what created that signal.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_d;Good. Let’s not keep the mystery waiting.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_e;Excellent. Let’s find out what it is.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_volcano_01;Ashley, I am registering a sharp thermal spike directly ahead. That area appears geologically unstable.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_volcano_01;Yeah, I see it. It's an active volcanic fissure.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_volcano_02;Be careful, Ashley. I am detecting a lot of hostile presence around it.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_volcano_02;I didn't know this area was volcanically active. It's quite a surprise to see a volcano in this place.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_volcano_03;Galatea 37 is a young planet with a lot of tectonic activity. Life started to form here much quicker than on Earth.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_volcano_03;It is certainly less stable, which makes it more dangerous, but also opens up a lot of opportunities. We could, for example, take advantage of all of the gas vents and mineral deposits around this fissure.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_volcano_04;Good idea, Ashley.;;;;;;;;;
gui/hud/objective_name/encounter/encounter_start;Locate anomalous area.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_hostile_hive_01;Wow, it's so nice over here. These water ponds look so clean!;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_hostile_hive_01;Be careful, Ashley. This idyllic scenery may be deceiving. I am detecting a number of hostile nests close by.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_hostile_hive_02;Roger that, Mr Riggs. Let's secure the area. I want to give it a better look once it's safer.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_hostile_hive_03_a;We haven't seen these creatures before, they didn't look native to the Tropical Zone.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_hostile_hive_03_b;How did these Stickrids get here? We haven't seen them outside the Fungal Swamp before. I don't see any traces of the wild fungal growth that we've seen over there.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_hostile_hive_02;They must have migrated here from a different biome. However, I can not detect any visible migration trail. It is not clear how they got here.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_hostile_hive_04;It looks like they had a hard time adjusting to this environment. They've practically picked this area clean. I'm not sure if they would be able to sustain themselves here for long. Either way, they certainly found a great place to set up camp. Maybe we could set up a small outpost between the lakes, just to drop by now and then to enjoy the view. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_hostile_hive_03;Certainly, that sounds like a perfectly logical reason to set up a base. However, mockery aside, this place does look easily defendable, so it might even make some sense.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_iceberg_01;Ashley, I am detecting an abrupt temperature drop just ahead. The shift is anomalous for this biome.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_desert_iceberg_01;What? Are these the same Cryo Plants that we've seen in the Volcanic Area.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_iceberg_02;Affirmative, they are responsible for the sharp temperature spike around this mountain.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_desert_iceberg_02;Interesting, the data that we gathered on this species earlier suggested that it creates a strong chemical reaction with specific volcanic gases. We might be walking on top of an active volcano right now.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_iceberg_03;We can verify this with the Geoscanner, Ashley.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_desert_iceberg_03;Good point, let's do some scanning around these rocks.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_iceberg_04;Warning! A group of hostile creatures is heading our way. Prepare for battle.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_iceberg_05;Threat eliminated. We can continue our investigation, Ashley;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_desert_iceberg_04;The data from the Geoscanner does indeed confirm that we're right in the middle of an ancient caldera with some volcanic activity. I have also detected Titanium ore deposits in the vicinity. These conditions are just enough for the Cryo Plants to survive. However, it does not explain how they got here in the first place. Are they the remnants of an ancient plant colony, or did they arrive here more recently? I will make a note of this for future scientists to study further.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_iceberg_06;Since you are the first to make this discovery, would you like to give it a name?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_desert_iceberg_05;You're right. Let's call this place the Krocoon Mountain. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_iceberg_07;A fitting name, Ashley. They gave us one hell of a fight here.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_hands_01;Warning. Radiation levels are increasing. The amount of Alpha and Beta particles hitting my sensors is off the charts. Gamma-ray emissions are less intense, but slowly approaching dangerous levels. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_desert_hands_01;Hold on… do you see that? Those rock pillars—tell me I’m not the only one seeing giant hands sticking out of the ground.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_hands_02;Affirmative, I see the formations. However, they do not resemble hands in any structural sense. You are experiencing a psychological effect known as Pareidolia.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_desert_hands_02;What?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_hands_03;Pareidolia is the human tendency to perceive familiar shapes—such as faces or limbs—in random or ambiguous visual patterns. These rock formations are coincidental.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_desert_hands_03;What about the increased radiation?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_desert_hands_04;Alpha and Beta radiation is a natural product of radioactive decay. These structures are primarily composed of rich Thorium ore. It is much more radioactive than any Thorium ore that could be found on Earth, but it does not appear to be out of place in this radioactive desert.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_desert_hands_04;I guess you're right. Either way, it does give me the creeps. I wouldn't want to have a base close to this thing.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_acid_arachnoid_pit_01;Danger! I am detecting two Omega Class creature signatures. They are just beyond the rocks ahead of us. Proceed with extreme caution.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_acid_arachnoid_pit_01;Interesting, that is a highly unusual configuration. They typically appear solo. Let's check if they are guarding something. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_acid_arachnoid_pit_02;It's very rare to see multiple Bioanomalies so close to each other. This place feels so strange.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_acid_arachnoid_pit_02;We still do not know what these Bioanomalies are or how they are formed. Neodymium isotope radiometric dating suggests that they are probably older than most life forms on this planet.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_acid_arachnoid_pit_03;We've seen them many times across the globe. They have different characteristics in each biome, but they are always covered with a strange type of growth. I tried collecting samples of it, but they always disintegrate when we try to do that. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_acid_arachnoid_pit_03;The attack waves that these bioanomalies draw to us appear to be their defense mechanism.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_acid_arachnoid_pit_04;Yes, I think so too. These things clearly want to be left alone. We've never seen any of the native species interacting with them. They also don't seem to affect the environment around them. Almost as if they were invisible. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_acid_arachnoid_pit_04;They could be an ancient environment monitoring system, or the remains of some specialized life form.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_acid_arachnoid_pit_05;It's really hard to say without gathering more data. Maybe we can find something out if we keep opening them up. I know we'll find out something useful one way or another.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_acid_hostile_nest_01;This is unusual. I'm seeing black smoke up ahead. It's either something burning or there's an active volcano over there. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_acid_hostile_nest_01;I am detecting multiple heat signatures in that area. It is probably a small lava flow from an open fissure.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_acid_hostile_nest_02;We haven't seen a lot of volcanoes in this part of the world, let's check it out.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_acid_hostile_nest_02;Danger! Multiple hostile creature nests ahead of us.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_acid_hostile_nest_03;The one in the middle is enormous. It's going to be a tough fight.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_acid_hostile_nest_03;We have cleared all of the hostile creature nests in this area.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_acid_hostile_nest_04;Good, this encounter was quite unexpected. This species doesn't usually appear in the Acidic Plains. They must have migrated towards the volcanic fissure. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_magma_morphium_01;Hey, Mr. Riggs. Look over there. Is that Morphium?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_magma_morphium_01;It looks like it. Please move closer so we can verify that.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_magma_morphium_02;Ashley, I confirm that this is a pool of Morphium. The rocks around it match the ones in the Metallic Valley.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_magma_morphium_02;This must be an impact crater from one of the X-Morph meteorites. We can take advantage of the Morphium from the pool, but we should watch out for any rogue replicants that might be roaming the area.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_magma_acid_01;Look, a sludge pool. We haven't seen these around here.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_magma_acid_01;Affirmative. It would have evaporated quickly in most areas of this zone, but the temperature around here is noticeably lower. It is only 362 kelvin in this small depression.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_magma_acid_02;I think I see a large Bioanomaly at the center of the pool. Let's go check it out.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_magma_acid_03;This sludge pool has an intriguing spiral shape. I wonder if it's coincidental.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_magma_acid_02;You are seeing things, Ashley. It is just your human imagination playing tricks with your mind.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_trap_01;Hey, what's this? There's a strong light coming from behind these rocks. Let's go see what it is.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_trap_01;Danger! Hostile units are coming in from all directions.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_trap_02;It's a trap! Shields up, Mr. Riggs.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_trap_03;This was a deliberate trap, Mr. Riggs. We have to be extra careful in the Metallic Valley. We have no idea how much is left of these X-Morph.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_trap_02;That is a good point, Ashley. However, I think it would be logical to assume that if they had any real power remaining, then they would take over this planet fairly quickly. The biggest risk that we are facing here is probably associated with activating dormant security systems.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_trap_04;Just like this one.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_trap_03;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_trap_05;But what if a security system started to replicate itself? ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_trap_04;Yes, that could theoretically become a problem. However, security systems are usually autonomous and self-contained. The risk of activating a self-replicating consciousness is close to zero. If you want to reduce this chance, then you should probably stop activating unknown artifacts.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_trap_06;Oh no, I'd rather increase it than decrease it. We didn't come here to hide under a blanket.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_trap_05;I sometimes fail to understand why you were chosen to lead this mission.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_trap_07;People who prefer stay-at-home jobs don't become Riftbreakers, Mr. Riggs. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_mud_01;Ashley, I have picked up something that might be of interest.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_mud_01;What is it?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_mud_02;That chasm over there contains water and tropical vegetation. Move closer to the edge if you want to see it.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_mud_02;Oh, that's unexpected. This hole is really not that deep. The metallic surface is just a few meters thick.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_mud_03;We are near the edge of the Metallic Valley crater, so it makes sense. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_mud_03;The thing that comes to my mind right now is the fact that a meteorite of the size that created this crater must have been enormous. This must have been a mass extinction event.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_mud_04;The crater is big, but its shape and the deformation of the surrounding geographical features indicate that the impact itself was not as disastrous as you might think. Its velocity might have been lower than you could expect or its density was lower than a typical heavy-metal asteroid.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_mud_04;Maybe the X-Morph were trying to slow down before they hit the planet, and the asteroid might have been hollow inside, like a spaceship.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_mud_05;Yes, that sounds plausible.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_mud_05;It's such a shame that we weren't able to talk to the X-Morph longer. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_mud_06;Who knows, maybe we will still have that chance one day.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_factory_01;Warning! We are approaching a dormant X-Morph biofactory. Proceed with extreme caution.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_factory_01;It's huge, I can see it from here. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_factory_02;Oh no. It's moving! We have to destroy it, Mr. Riggs. We can't leave it here like that. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_factory_02;X-Morph biofactory destroyed. Objective accomplished.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_factory_03;It was much larger than the ones we've seen before. I think it activated because of our presence. I wonder how many of these machines still remain here.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_metallic_factory_03;I do not think that is relevant. They do not seem to pose any danger when left undisturbed. They do not seem to have any centralized intelligence any more.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_metallic_factory_04;I hope you are right, Mr. Riggs. I hope you are right.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_caverns_magnet_01;Warning! Powerful magnetic disturbance detected.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_caverns_magnet_01;It's blocking our sensors. Navigation systems are offline, and we can't rift jump from here.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_caverns_magnet_02;The source of this magnetic anomaly must be very powerful, but it should not be that difficult to locate. We should find it and neutralize it. Otherwise, it is going to make exploring this area very difficult.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_caverns_magnet_02;We found it, Mr. Riggs. It's an enormous Magnetic Rock, much bigger than the ones we've seen in the Volcanic Area.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_caverns_magnet_03;This one is too big to destroy with acidic weapons. There is probably nothing we can do about it. The best solution is to avoid this area.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_caverns_magnet_03;I think there's a way. We could construct magnetic stabilizers around it and use them to find its resonance frequency. We could then emit a strong magnetic pulse at a frequency that could destabilize these rocks, and hopefully shatter them.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_caverns_magnet_04;We could try to do that. However, Magnetic Stabilizers are very expensive to build. We are not sure if this procedure would even work. And there is absolutely zero economic benefit to such an endeavor. After careful analysis and deep data ressearch I suggest a more effective solution. Lets walk away from here.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_caverns_magnet_04;Well, after careful consideration. I agree with your motion of thought. Let's just get out of here.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_caverns_green_energy_01;Warning! Dangerous radiation detected. We are approaching a strong gamma-ray emitter. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_caverns_green_energy_01;Roger that, Mr. Riggs. Let's move closer to see what it is.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_caverns_green_energy_02;Wow, this looks like a natural nuclear reactor. As much as this is surprising, things like that existed even on Earth.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_caverns_green_energy_02;I am detecting rich uranium ore deposits around this site. You can try to search for them with the Geoscanner. ;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_caverns_green_energy_03;Good idea, Mr. Riggs. Let's see what we can find.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_swamp_octopus_01;Wow, look over there, Mr. Riggs. What is that thing?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_swamp_octopus_01;Ba careful, Ashley, we do not know if it is hostile or not.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_swamp_octopus_02;Let's move a little closer to see what it is.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_swamp_octopus_02;It does not appear to notice our presence. We should be safe here.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_swamp_octopus_03;At first, it looked like a giant, frenzied octopus in a smoke cloud, but its movement pattern isn't chaotic. It's doing the same thing over and over again. I think it's spreading the spore cloud with this movement.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_swamp_octopus_03;I concur, Ashley. It looked dangerous because of its size, but it appears to be harmless.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_swamp_octopus_04;The flora and fauna in the Fungal Swamp are weirder than anything I have ever seen. This thing stacks right next to Poogrets, Garlimonium, and the Canceroth. It's like someone was reading too much of H.P. Lovecraft.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_swamp_octopus_04;Pleasure to me is wonder—the unexplored, the unexpected, the thing that is hidden and the changeless thing that lurks behind superficial mutability. To trace the remote in the immediate; the eternal in the ephemeral; the past in the present; the infinite in the finite; these are to me the springs of delight and beauty.;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_swamp_octopus_05;It sounds as if he had dreamt of becoming a Riftbreaker.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_swamp_stump_01;Wow, look over there, Mr. Riggs. I think we've found the remains of another Great Mushroom Tree.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_swamp_stump_01;Yes, that stump is enormous.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_swamp_stump_02;Let's move closer to check it out.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_swamp_stump_03;It looks very old. It must have been beautiful when it was alive. The root system beneath it is very well exposed. It would be fascinating to explore the caverns beneath it.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_swamp_stump_02;Maybe some other time, Ashley. We have enough to do above ground.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_swamp_stump_03;Look, over here, Ashley. Parabians. The same parasite species that infected The Great Mushroom Tree.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_swamp_stump_04;Interesting, it looks like they are feeding off what's left here. This tree has died from natural causes. It wasn't attacked by the Darkthorn. I guess there is no point in disturbing these bugs. Nature has run its course.;;;;;;;;;
