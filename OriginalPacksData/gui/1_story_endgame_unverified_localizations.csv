DIALOG/story/endgame/mech_mega_rift_charging_01;Prime Rift Station activated. The portal is opening up. It should not take long.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/story/endgame/ashley_mega_rift_charging_01;No. I don't think so. This rift is opening very slowly. I'm not sure why you thought this would be any simpler than the first portal.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/story/endgame/mech_mega_rift_charging_02;That might have been a small miscalculation. Ashley, I think we have a bigger problem. I am detecting a lot of movement heading towards the Rift Station.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/story/endgame/ashley_mega_rift_charging_02;<sigh> Ok, then. Let's treat this as the final test of our base defenses.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/story/endgame/mech_mega_rift_charged_01;Prime Rift Station has finished charging. The Quantum Synchronization Core is ready.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/story/endgame/ashley_mega_rift_charged_01;Roger that, Mr. Riggs. This is it. It's finally time to go.;;;;;;;;;

DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_a;Ashley, my sensors are picking up anomalous readings within this location.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_b;Ashley, I am detecting some unusual data patterns in this sector.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_c;Anomalous signals detected. Something does not fit within this area.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_d;Something strange is happening in this zone. I am getting readings that are inconsistent with the surrounding environment.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_01_e;My instruments are detecting anomalous fluctuations in this location. The source is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_a;Interesting. Can you locate these readings?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_b;Can you pinpoint the source?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_c;Ok, you have my attention. Can you share any more specific information?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_d;Noted. Can you provide coordinates for the source?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_01_e;Understood. Can you explain the nature of the anomaly?;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_a;Yes, but I need some time to gather more data.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_b;The readings are inconsistent. I need more time to analyze the data.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_c;I am in the process of triangulating the origin. Please stand by for updated coordinates. This may take some time.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_d;I have detected a pattern, but it is too weak to determine its origin conclusively. Please give me more time to analyze the data.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_detected_02_e;My data is fragmented. I need more time to reconstruct its point of origin.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_a;Ok, let's try to find it ourselves in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_b;Alright, we will keep moving and see what turns up.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_c;Understood. I will continue searching until you have something solid.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_d;Guess we’ll have to do it the old-fashioned way for now. We’ll poke around and see what we find.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_detected_02_e;Just let me know when you've got something concrete. I’ll keep moving.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_a;Data analysis complete. I have an approximate location of the anomaly that I detected earlier.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_b;I have completed processing the data from the anomaly that I recorded a few minutes ago. I have marked its approximate position.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_c;The results of the earlier anomaly scan are conclusive. I am uploading its estimated location to our map.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_d;I have finished analyzing the signals from the previously observed anomaly. I have marked its approximate location.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_anomaly_location_01_e;I have finished processing the data from the anomaly that I recorded earlier. I have calculated an approximate position for investigation.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_a;Excellent. Mark it on our map and let's see what it is.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_b;Alright, let’s see what kind of weirdness we’re dealing with.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_c;Nice. I’ve been waiting to figure out what created that signal.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_d;Good. Let’s not keep the mystery waiting.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_anomaly_location_01_e;Excellent. Let’s find out what it is.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_volcano_01;Ashley, I am registering a sharp thermal spike directly ahead. That area appears geologically unstable.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_volcano_01;Yeah, I see it. It's an active volcanic fissure.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_volcano_02;Be careful, Ashley. I am detecting a lot of hostile presence around it.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_volcano_02;I didn't know this area was volcanically active. It's quite a surprise to see this volcano here.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_volcano_03;Galtea 37 is a young planet that is much more tectonically active. Life started to form here much quicker than on Earth.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/ashley_jungle_volcano_03;It is certainly much less stable, which makes it more dangerous, but also opens up a lot of opportunities. We could, for example, take advantage of all of the gas vents and mineral deposits around this fissure.;;;;;;;;;
DIALOG/encounters/mech_jungle_volcano_04;Good idea, Ashley.;;;;;;;;;
gui/hud/objective_name/encounter/encounter_start;Locate anomalous area.;;;;;;;;;
