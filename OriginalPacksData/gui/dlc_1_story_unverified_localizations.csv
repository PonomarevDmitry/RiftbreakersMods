DIALOG/story/dlc_1/mech_crash_site_inside_05;We should remove all hostile presence from the area before we try to study this site in more detail.;;;;;;;在试图更详细地研究这个地方之前，我们应该将所有敌对存在从这个地区清除出去。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_lakes_final_attack_01;There's limited space to build strong defenses on land, but we can take advantage of Morphium Towers and place them directly on the liquid. I think they should be the most effective when placed in groups so they can back up each other with shields.;;;;;;;在陆地上建立强大防御的空间有限，但我们可以利用形变液塔的优势，把它们直接放在液体上。我认为它们在成组放置时应该是最有效的，这样它们可以用护盾互相支援。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/mech_lakes_final_attack_01;That is a good idea, Ashley. We can build forward Morphium Tower lines that surround our outpost and support them with a few artillery towers placed on land.;;;;;;;这是个好主意，阿雪莉。我们可以建立环绕我们前哨站的形变液塔前线，并用放置在陆地上的一些火炮塔来支援它们。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_lakes_final_attack_02;Excellent. That was a tough fight, but we can now safely export Morphium from this location. This resource can prove very useful for strengthening our presence on Galatea.;;;;;;;好极了。刚才是一场艰苦的战斗，但我们现在可以安全地从这个地方出口形变液。这种资源证明对于加强我们在伽拉忒亚的存在非常有用。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/mech_alien_base_shield_01;The central X-Morph structure is surrounded by a force field. We will not be able to pass through it.;;;;;;;中央的X变体结构被一个力场所包围。我们无法通过它。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_alien_base_shield_01;We'll think of something, but first, let's secure the area.;;;;;;;我们会想出办法的，但首先，让我们保护这个地区。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/mech_alien_base_shield_02;Ashley, the X-Morph force-field just disappeared. We can enter the structure.;;;;;;;阿雪莉，X变体的力场刚刚消失了。我们可以进入这个结构了。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_alien_base_shield_02;Oh, that's almost too easy...;;;;;;;哦，这几乎太容易了…;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_familiarity_wingmite_01;Are these dragonflies? They have metallic wings and reinforced carapaces, but the majority of their bodies is organic. This is very odd.;;;;;;;这些是蜻蜓吗？它们有金属翅膀和强化的甲壳，但它们身体的大部分是有机的。这是非常奇怪的。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/mech_familiarity_wingmite_01;Watch out for this species, Ashley. It looks very aggressive and can fly over terrain obstacles.;;;;;;;留意这个物种，阿雪莉。它看起来很有攻击性，可以飞越地形障碍。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_familiarity_bradron_01;Is this a drone or a creature? It doesn't look natural.;;;;;;;这是一个无人机还是一个生物？它看起来并不是天然的。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/mech_familiarity_bradron_01;These flying, round creatures are bio-mechanical hybrid organisms. However, I would not classify them as typical cyborgs. I can not see a clear distinction between organic and mechanical parts. All of their elements function perfectly together.;;;;;;;这些飞行的圆形生物是生物机械的混合体。然而，我不会把它们归类为典型的机械人。我看不出有机和机械部分之间有什么明显的区别。他们所有的元素都完美地结合在一起。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_familiarity_bradron_02;They either evolved this way, or they've been bio-engineered. Both options are equally disturbing. Let's see what other curiosities we can find here.;;;;;;;他们要么是以这种方式进化，要么是被生物工程化。这两种情况都同样令人不安。让我们看看在这里还能发现什么其他令人好奇的东西。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_familiarity_brabit_01;This calm Brabit species must be related to the flying "laser eye" Bradron creatures. They share a lot of common characteristics and have a very similar internal organ structure. Their metallic "evil-twin" has been bio-engineered to grow a metallic shell that serves as protective armor and their huge eye was modified to function as a mining tool or a weapon.;;;;;;;这个平和的巨眼怪物种一定与飞行的"镭射眼"融合巨眼怪生物有关。它们有很多共同的特征，并且有非常相似的内部器官结构。它们的金属"邪恶双生"经过生物工程改造，长出了一个金属外壳，作为保护性盔甲，而它们巨大的眼睛经过改造，可以作为采矿工具或武器使用。;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_familiarity_morphium_01;Hey, what's this shining pool of liquid over there?;;;;;;;嘿，那边这个闪亮的液体池是什么？;;
DIALOG/story/dlc_1/ashley_familiarity_morphium_02;Maybe we can find a use for this substance later. I'd love to study it further.;;;;;;;也许我们以后能找到这种物质的用途。我很想进一步研究它。;;
